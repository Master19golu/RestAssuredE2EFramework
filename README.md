Don't forget to give a ‚≠ê if you find the project useful.

This project is the outcome of my self-learning about the API Testing Automation framework - Rest-assured.I started doing some handson and explored more about its core features and other helper libraries. I started learning about the framework and have documented all my learnings in this repository with all example code from writing basic tests to running end to end API automation tests.

Tech Stack:
1. JDK 17
2. Maven Build tool
3. TestNG for test runner and parallel execution
4. Allure Report for reporting
5. CI/CD pipeline using Docker and Jenkins

This repo contains RestAssured codes, in addition to -Hamcrest Matchers helpful for writing testng assertions, Lombok is used to generate Getters and Setters automatically for requests, POJO classes are used for Serialization and De-Serialization, Utilities classes have been used for handling JSONPath, XMLPath, Excel etc, Jackson and Jayway APIs are used for Validation.
